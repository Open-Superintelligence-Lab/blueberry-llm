# Auto-Configuration System: Simple Approach

## The Problem
Currently users need to manually configure:
- Model size (d_model, layers, heads)
- Batch sizes and memory settings  
- Parallelization strategies
- Dataset selection
- Hardware-specific optimizations

## The Solution: 3 Files Only

```
blueberry-llm/
├── llm.py              # Your existing model (unchanged)
├── auto_config.py      # ONE file with all auto-config logic  
├── train.py            # Auto-training script
├── setup.sh            # One-click setup
└── requirements.txt    # Updated dependencies
```

**Goal**: `git clone` → `./setup.sh` → `python train.py` → **it just works**

## Why This Simple Structure Is Better

❌ **Complex approach** (what I originally proposed):
- 15+ files across 5 directories
- Hard to understand and debug
- Over-engineered for most users
- Maintenance nightmare

✅ **Simple approach**:
- Everything in `auto_config.py` (~200 lines)
- Easy to read and modify
- Zero learning curve
- Actually gets used

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create `auto_config.py` 
One class that detects hardware and returns optimal config:

```python
from auto_config import auto_configure

configurator = auto_configure()  # Detects everything
configurator.print_config()      # Shows what it found
model_config = configurator.get_model_config()  # Returns your MoEModelConfig
```

### 2. Update `train.py`
Make it auto-configure by default, but still allow manual override:

```python
python train.py                    # Auto-config (most users)
python train.py --manual-config   # Use existing manual setup
```

### 3. Create `setup.sh`
One script that installs everything and tests the setup:

```bash
./setup.sh   # Installs dependencies, tests GPU, ready to train
```

## Key Auto-Configuration Logic

**Hardware Detection**:
- Number of GPUs
- Memory per GPU  
- GPU types (consumer vs datacenter)
- Interconnect (PCIe vs NVLink)

**Model Scaling Rules**:
- < 16GB total: Small model (256d, 4L, 4H)
- 16-64GB: Medium model (384d, 6L, 8H) 
- 64-256GB: Large model (768d, 12L, 12H)
- 256GB+: XL model (1536d, 24L, 24H)

**Training Optimizations**:
- Batch size fits in memory
- Gradient accumulation for effective large batches
- Mixed precision on compatible hardware
- Distributed training for multi-GPU

**Smart Defaults**:
- Dataset size matches hardware capability
- Reasonable training steps for quick iteration
- Conservative memory usage (80% max)

This approach makes your project immediately usable by anyone while still being powerful enough for serious research.
