# Bug Fixes for Reasoning Architecture (Exp8)

## Summary
Fixed multiple critical bugs causing high loss and training failures in the reasoning model.

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. **Division by Zero in LR Scheduler**
**Location:** `run_experiment.py` and `run_ablations.py`

**Issue:** When `warmup_steps == max_steps`, the scheduler crashed with division by zero.

**Fix:**
```python
# Before
return max(0.1, (self.config.max_steps - step) / (self.config.max_steps - self.config.warmup_steps))

# After
decay_steps = max(1, self.config.max_steps - self.config.warmup_steps)
return max(0.1, (self.config.max_steps - step) / decay_steps)
```

### 2. **Incorrect Base Model Forward Calls in Recursive Reasoning**
**Location:** `recursive_reasoning.py` lines 200, 214, 224, 234

**Issue:** Called `base_model()` with `return_aux_loss=False` but expected dict output with `.last_hidden_state` attribute, causing AttributeError.

**Fix:** Changed all calls to use `return_aux_loss=True, return_dict=True, output_hidden_states=True` to properly get dict output from MoE model.

### 3. **Missing Embedding Scaling in Recursive Wrapper**
**Location:** `recursive_reasoning.py` lines 173-184

**Issue:** MoE model scales embeddings by `sqrt(d_model)` internally, but recursive wrapper didn't match this when getting embeddings directly, causing scale mismatch.

**Fix:**
```python
if hasattr(self.base_model, 'token_embedding'):
    embeddings = self.base_model.token_embedding(input_ids)
    # MoE model scales embeddings - match that scaling
    if hasattr(self.base_model.config, 'd_model'):
        import math
        embeddings = embeddings * math.sqrt(self.base_model.config.d_model)
```

### 4. **Incorrect Logits Generation**
**Location:** `recursive_reasoning.py` line 244

**Issue:** Called `self.base_model.lm_head(z_H)` separately after already getting output from base model, potentially causing inconsistent logits.

**Fix:** Use logits from the last model output instead: `logits = h_output.logits`

### 5. **Learning Rate Too High**
**Location:** `config.py` line 38, 105

**Issue:** Learning rate of 2e-3 (0.002) was too high for MoE + recursive architecture, causing instability.

**Fix:** Reduced to 3e-4 (0.0003) for better stability.

### 6. **Too Many Recursive Cycles**
**Location:** `config.py` line 145-147, `models.py` line 166-168

**Issue:** Default H_cycles=3, L_cycles=3 meant 12+ forward passes per batch, extremely slow and potentially unstable.

**Fix:** Reduced to H_cycles=2, L_cycles=2 (6 forward passes), halt_max_steps=3 for faster, more stable training.

### 7. **Warmup Steps Too Long for Short Runs**
**Location:** `config.py` line 41

**Issue:** warmup_steps=10 was only 10% of max_steps=100, but original config had warmup_steps=100 which would equal max_steps causing the division by zero.

**Fix:** Set warmup_steps=20 (20% of 100 steps) for better warmup schedule.

## Performance Impact

### Before Fixes:
- Training crashed with division by zero at step 100
- Recursive model couldn't run at all (AttributeError)
- High loss (~10.8 → ~7.7 in 80 steps, but would crash)

### After Fixes:
- Training completes successfully
- Validation loss achieves ~6.9-7.0
- Perplexity ~1000-1100 (reasonable for 100 steps, small model, large vocab)
- Both baseline and recursive models can train

## Notes on "High Loss"

The initial loss of ~10.8 is **EXPECTED and NORMAL**:
- Vocabulary size: 49,152 tokens
- Random baseline (uniform distribution): log(49152) ≈ 10.80
- After 100 steps with small model: ~6.9-7.0 is good progress
- For comparison, good LLMs on this data need 1000s of steps to reach loss <4.0

The model IS learning correctly - the user's concern about "huge loss" was based on not accounting for the large vocabulary size.

## Ablation Study

Created `run_ablations.py` with 15 different configurations testing:
1. Baseline (MoE only)
2. Recursive reasoning
3-4. Different learning rates (1e-4, 6e-4)
5-6. Warmup variations (50 steps, 0 steps)
7. Smaller model (256d, 4 layers)
8. Fewer experts (4 instead of 4)
9. More top-k experts (4 instead of 2)
10-11. Gradient clipping variations (0.5, 5.0)
12. Recursive with very low LR (1e-4)
13. Very low LR baseline (5e-5)
14. No dropout
15. Low dropout (0.05)

All run for 100 steps for quick diagnosis.
