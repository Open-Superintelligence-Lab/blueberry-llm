## Comparison

| Metric | Baseline | Reasoning | Baseline Advantage |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Val Loss** | **4.89** | 5.81 | ‚úÖ 15.9% better |
| **Perplexity** | **133** | 335 | ‚úÖ 60.3% better |
| **Accuracy** | **27.23%** | 20.28% | ‚úÖ 34.3% better |

| **Training Time** | **2.1 min** | 3.2 min | ‚úÖ 34.4% faster |

## Key Findings

### 1. **Baseline Wins for Short Training**
With only 1000 steps, the simpler baseline model significantly outperforms recursive reasoning:
- Better final loss (4.89 vs 5.81)
- Better accuracy (27% vs 20%)
- Faster training (2.1min vs 3.2min)

### 2. **Higher LR is Critical**
- Baseline uses LR=6e-4 (2x higher than reasoning)
- This aggressive learning rate helps rapid convergence
- Reasoning model's lower LR (3e-4) is more conservative

### 3. **Recursive Overhead**
- Reasoning model is 57% slower (5.3 vs 8.3 steps/s)
- Multiple forward passes (H=1, L=1 still means 2-3x more compute)
- Slower convergence despite similar improvement rate (23% vs 22%)

### 4. **Learning Curves**
Both models show good learning:
- Baseline: 10.8 ‚Üí 4.89 (55% reduction)
- Reasoning: 10.8 ‚Üí 5.81 (46% reduction)

But baseline learns faster due to higher LR.

## Recommendations

### For 1000 Steps or Less: Use Baseline
```python
learning_rate = 6e-4
warmup_steps = 0
dropout = 0.1
use_recursive = False
```
**Expected:** Val loss ~4.9, Perplexity ~130, Accuracy ~27%

### For 2000+ Steps: Consider Reasoning
Recursive reasoning may show benefits with longer training:
- Lower LR (3e-4) allows finer optimization
- More compute per step could lead to better final performance
- Warmup helps stabilize longer runs

**Hypothesis:** Reasoning might surpass baseline at 3000-5000 steps

### For Production: Depends on Goal
- **Fast iteration:** Baseline (faster training, good results)
- **Best final performance:** Train both for 5000+ steps and compare
- **Inference speed:** Baseline (no recursive overhead)

## Ablation Study Summary

### Baseline Ablations (15 configs)
**Best:** `4_high_lr` (LR=6e-4, no warmup)
- 100 steps: 6.67 val loss
- 1000 steps: **4.89 val loss** ‚úÖ

**Range:** 6.67 to 9.46 val loss (100 steps)

### Reasoning Ablations (15 configs)
**Best:** `R02_minimal` (H=1, L=1)
- 100 steps: 7.59 val loss
- 1000 steps: **5.81 val loss**

**Range:** 7.59 to 8.45 val loss (100 steps)

### Key Insight
Minimal recursion (H=1, L=1) beats deeper recursion (H=2, L=2 or H=3, L=3) for limited training. Simpler is better with constrained compute.

## Conclusion

**For 1000-step training: Baseline wins decisively.**

The simpler MoE baseline with aggressive learning rate (6e-4) and no warmup achieves:
- 16% better validation loss
- 60% better perplexity
- 34% faster training

Recursive reasoning shows promise but needs longer training (2000+ steps) to demonstrate advantages. The added complexity and slower training don't pay off in short runs.

**Bottom line:** Use baseline for quick experiments, consider reasoning only for extensive training runs (5000+ steps).
